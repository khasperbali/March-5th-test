				<h4>What are WireFrames and Why We use Them?</h4>
					<p>Wireframes are designs that we see in our head and we draw them to get a better idea of what needs to change. Also wireframes help in groups to show what the other members see and it makes it easier to collaberate with the other memebers on conflicting ideas. We use these so we have a design to follow when coding out our application and it makes sure we don't stray away from our first idea.</p>

				<h4>Git Workflow</h4>
					<p>Github workflow works when collaborating in groups because the main leader gets to over look on everyones progress and makes sure that they are doing their part. Everyone gets their own individual branches or section to work on the whole code. Also branches allow the others to see the changes they made and can vote on whether they want it in the master branch or not. This means that everyone can work on what they want and send a push request to the leader to merge their code to the master. The leader then looks and either decides to merge it with the master or not to merge it. After he merges it, everyone must pull it to their master branch to keep the code from conflicting or not work when they want to push thiers.</p>

				<h4>Ways to Create a responsive Web Design</h4>
					<p>A responsive web design is a web page that reacts to the different types of electronics that the user is on. Like if a user were to go from a phone or tablet to a computer the webpage would look very different. Four ways that happens is:
						<li>Using percentages</li>
						Percentages help keep the width to whatever percent it is instead of pixels
						<li>Using DOM or Document Object Module</li>
						This allows for certain HTML and CSS attributes/properties to be modified
						<li>Using a specific code</li>
						I can't remember what it is but it will change how your webpage looks on different devices
						<li>Using methods that allow for user interaction</li>
						Using the OnClick method or hover allows for the user to interact with that element on the webpage
